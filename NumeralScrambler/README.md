# Scrambled Numerals

In this problem, you will receive a string input of scrambled characters. 
These characters, when de-scrambled properly will be made up of string representations of numerals.
For example `reuonnoinfe` will correspond to `one,four,nine`
## Deliverable
You will implement a program such that you descramble these input strings 
and print out the integer representation of the output. These integer representations
should have the smallest numerals at the leftmost and the largest numerals at the rightmost.
For example `reuonnoinfe` should output `149`.
